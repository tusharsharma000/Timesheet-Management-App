## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

use these creds to login
 email - user@example.com
 password - password


1. Have created routes and api call locally for data 
2. Used next auth for authentication.
3. used hardcoded data, reloading will loose all the data . I haven't used local storage since i am using local api that's why
4. Functionality is working fine, i have tested.
5. Used the jest library for testing purposes.
